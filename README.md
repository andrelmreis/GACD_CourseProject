Besides this README.txt file, this repository contains two other files: CodeBook.md and run_analysis.R .
- CodeBook.md is a markdown file that describes the modifications made to the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.
- run_analysis.R is an R script created with R version 3.2.0, whose output is a text file with the cleaned data set described in the CodeBook.
